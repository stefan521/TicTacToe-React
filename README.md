This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
Weekend fun. This project started when I took React's tutorial so the code is based on that [turtorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I added a bunch of things since then, such as tests with Jest and Enzyme, static type checking with flow and es-lint to improve my style. I also made the board responsive.
