This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About
Weekend fun. This project started when I took [React's tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) so the code is based on that. I added a bunch of things since then, such as tests with Jest and Enzyme, static type checking with flow and es-lint to improve my style. I also made the board responsive.

## Run the project
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Navigate to TicTacToe-React and run these commands:
```npm install```
```npm start```

The project should open automatically. If it doesn't, navigate to localhot:3000 in your browser.

## Test
Unit test: ```npm test```
Coverage reports: ```npm run coverage```
